                <h2>Why is HecoAnalytics needed?</h2>
                <p>HecoAnalytics provides health economic tools and solutions, within a business context, to enable
                    companies to engage early and affordably with health economics enabling them to develop better, more
                    effective products designed to meet commissioners’ and healthcare systems’ needs. The output of
                    HecoAnalytics tools are aligned with the requirements of the National Institute of Care and Health
                    Excellence (NICE) technology assessment (HTA) programmes such as, the Medical Technologies
                    Evaluation Programme (MTEP) to demonstrate the value of a company’s product to NICE but also other
                    HTA bodies and payers. Our mission is to provide companies with appropiate, understandable and
                    actionable health economic support that will assist the company in marketing its products and
                    interacting with HTA agencies in a number of geographies. HecoAnalytics facilitation sessions offer
                    extensive interaction with experienced staff to ensure that clients gain maximum value from the
                    process, delivering actionable, user friendly output rather than simply providing academic reports.
                    Furthermore, the integrated nature of HecoAnalytics deliverables means that previous work can
                    informed future work and models and ideas can be easily and efficiently updated as new information
                    is generated.</p>
                <p>
                    HecoAnalytics uses the accepted practice of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a new technology in
                    comparison to an existing gold standard technology, similar to that used by <a

                <h2>How the HecoAnalytics platform works</h2>
                <p>HecoAnalytics builds on over a decade of academic research in Health Economics and Computer Science.
                    HecoAnalytics uses the latest computing technology such as machine learning (ML), artificial
                    Intelligence (AI) and other data science techniques to streamline health economic processes and
                    models. In addition to our own staff, the company leverages a network of world-leading academic
                    health economists so that appropriate domain expertise can be brought to bear on clients’ projects
                    in a cost-effective manner. HecoAnalytics is also a licensed facilitator for the NICE META Tool, an
                    online evidence gap analysis tool.
                </p>

                <p>HecoAnalytics provides a unique set of data-driven health evidence services:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Early evaluation and scoping as a licensed facilitation organisation for the NICE MedTech Early
                        Assessment (META) Tool – building an Evidence Map with PICO analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li>Systematic Literature reviews can then be used to better understand competitor offerings and
                        pathway impact, augmenting the Evidence Map.
                    </li>
                    <li>Early health economic models using HecoCalc provide a scenario-based approach to analysing
                        health and cost effectiveness. Budget impact and more detail health economic modelling and
                        simulation can follow.
                    </li>
                    <li>Data collection (HeConnect) and AI tools (HecoPath) can be used to refine models with more detailed pathway representations and patient groupings.
