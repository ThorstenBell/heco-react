                <h2>Why is HecoAnalytics needed?</h2>
                <p>HecoAnalytics provides health economic tools and solutions, within a business context, to enable
                    companies to
                    engage early and affordably with health economics enabling them to develop better, more effective
                    products
                    designed to meet commissioners’ and healthcare systems’ needs. The output of HecoAnalytics tools are
                    aligned
                    with the requirements of the National Institute of Care and Health Excellence (NICE) technology
                    assessment (HTA)
                    programmes such as, the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme (MTEP) to demonstrate the value of
                    a company’s
                    product to NICE but also other HTA bodies and payers. Our mission is to provide companies with
                    appropriate,
                    understandable and actionable health economic support that will assist the company in marketing its
                    products and
                    interacting with HTA agencies in a number of geographies. HecoAnalytics facilitation sessions offer
                    extensive
                    interaction with experienced staff to ensure that clients gain maximum value from the process,
                    delivering
                    actionable, user-friendly output rather than simply providing academic reports. Furthermore, the
                    integrated
                    nature of HecoAnalytics deliverables means that previous work can informed future work and models
                    and ideas can
                    be easily and efficiently updated as new information is generated.
                </p>
                <p>HecoAnalytics uses the accepted practice of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a new technology in
                    comparison
                    to an existing gold standard technology, similar to that used by NICE.

                <h2>How the HecoAnalytics platform works</h2>
                <p>HecoAnalytics builds on over a decade of academic research in Health Economics and Computer Science.
                    HecoAnalytics uses the latest computing technology such as machine learning (ML), artificial
                    Intelligence (AI)
                    and other data science techniques to streamline health economic processes and models. In addition to
                    our own
                    staff, the company leverages a network of world-leading academic health economists so that
                    appropriate domain
                    expertise can be brought to bear on clients’ projects in a cost-effective manner. HecoAnalytics is
                    also a
                    licensed facilitator for the NICE META Tool, an online evidence gap analysis tool.

                <h2>What you can do with HecoAnalytics</h2>
                <p>HecoAnalytics is able to provide all services associated with health economic evidence generation and
                    support of
                    market access and HTA activities. The typical process of projects that HecoAnalytics undertakes for
                    companies
                    includes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>NICE Medtech Early Technical Assessment (META) Tool - an affordable, online, platform developed
                        by NICE to
                        help product developers understand what evidence is needed to make a convincing case to payers
                        and
                        commissioners for their technology. It is delivered by HecoAnalytics under licence to NICE as a
                        Facilitating Organisation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Value Proposition (VP) Development – a clear argument to support commissioning of the product
                        backed by
                        measurable data and a robust evidence base. A principal objective to understand where the
                        product will fall
                        within the cost-effectiveness plane compared to the current Standard of Care (SoC).
                    </li>
                    <li>Early Health Economic Modelling (EEM) - an exercise to gain an appreciation of the possible
                        cost-effectiveness of proposed interventions. EEM is employed to evaluate the potential
                        cost-effectiveness
                        related to different product performance characteristics, potential pricing of the product or
                        results of
                        clinical trials. Often this can be the first supporting evidence that a product, or
                        intervention, has
                        clinical and commercial potential.
                    </li>
                    <li>Budget Impact (BI) Model development - A budget impact analysis is an economic assessment that
                        estimates the
                        financial consequences of adopting a new intervention for a specific budget holder resulting
                        from a decision
                        to reimburse a new healthcare intervention. A budget impact analysis evaluates whether the
                        intervention is
                        affordable for a budget holder.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cost Effectiveness (CE) Model development - A cost-effectiveness analysis evaluates whether an
                        intervention
                        offers value relative to an existing intervention, usually the Standard of Care (SoC), the
                        outcomes are
                        defined as cost relative to specified health outcomes. A cost-effectiveness analysis evaluates
                        whether an
                        intervention represents value for money compared to comparable interventions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Development of real time data collection and economic analysis – HeConnect. HecoAnalytics can
                        assist in data
                        integration from a Digital Health Technology (DHT) or app into health economic models (including
                        real time).
                        Consequently, facilitating significant improvements in the quality and quantity of data that are
                        collected
                        and the speed at which economic models can be produced that can be updated with new data as they
                        become
                        available.
                    </li>
                    <li>Development of AI and machine learning for analysing trial, public and private health data.
                        Findings are
                        able to target products or patient groups in order to improve health economic models.
