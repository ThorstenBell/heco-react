                    </li>
                    <li>we may collect and summarize customer information in an aggregate format for
                        internal statistical and research purposes. We may, for example, summarize our data

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you decide to
                    do this, we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you
                    requested. For example, some of our services will not be able to display all computed
                    information.</p>
                <h4>1.2 Supplementing Information</h4>
                <p>From time to time we may supplement the information you give us with information from
                    other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information you
                    have provided us. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and
                    to help us provide better service.</p>
                <h3>2.HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM YOU</h3>

                <h4>2.1 Service Usage Follow-Up, Surveys, and Customer Research</h4>
                <p>Following a purchase, we may send you a follow-up letter to thank you for your business, or

                <p>We may use contact information collected online to conduct occasional surveys and other
                    customer research. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to
                    participate. The information obtained through our surveys and customer research is used to
                    help us understand our customers, to enhance our product and service offerings, promotions
                    and events, and/or to assist in the selection of store locations.</p>
                <h4>2.2 Online Accounts</h4>

                <h4>2.3 Customer Reviews</h4>
                <p>Customer Review functionality is provided as a rating system that offers you the chance to

                <h3>3.INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY</h3>
                <p>In some cases, we automatically collect certain information.</p>
                <h4>3.1 Our Web Sites</h4>
                <p>Our Web Sites can be browsed without you providing us with any personal information.
                    However, when using our Web Sites, we may collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address of
                    your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access
                    our Web Sites, the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our
                    Web Site, the operating system you are using, the sections of the Web Site you visit, the Web
                    Site pages read and images viewed, and the content you download from the Web Site.
                    This information is used for Web Site and system administration purposes, to understand
                    Web Site activity, and to improve the Web Sites.</p>
                <h4>3.2 Cookies, Tracer Tags, and Web Beacons</h4>
                <p>The Web Sites use "cookies", a tiny element of data that our Web Sites can send to your
                    browser, which may then be stored on a Web Site user's computer to permit the Web Site to
                    recognize future visits using that browser. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the
                    Web Site. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as
                    a previous user of the Web Site (so you do not have to enter your language preference every
                    time), to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use, to track your
                    activity at the Web Site, to respond to your needs, and to otherwise facilitate your Web Site
                    experience. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may
                    affect your use of the Web Site and your ability to access certain features of the Web Site or
                    engage in transactions through the Web Site.</p>
                <p>Our Web Sites or email communications may also use technology such as "tracer tags" or
                    “Web Beacons”. This technology allows us to understand which areas of our emails you click
                    on and our behaviour on our Web Sites, such as which pages you visit. These tracer tags are
                    used to help us optimize and tailor our Web Site for you and other future visitors to our Web
                    Site, and to help provide you with email content and ads tailored to your interests.</p>
                <h4>3.3 Web Site Tracking Information</h4>
                <p>We may use web beacons or pixel tags to compile tracking information reports regarding
                    Web Site user demographics, Web Site traffic patterns, and Web Site purchases. We may
                    then provide these reports to advertisers and others. For our own research purposes, we may
                    link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided to us. Once such a
                    link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used
                    and disclosed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h4>3.4 Social Media</h4>
                <p>We may offer you the opportunity to engage with our content on or through third-party social
                    networking websites, plug-ins, and applications. When you engage with our content on or
                    through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins, and applications, you may allow us
                    to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (e.g., name,
                    username, email address, profile picture, gender) to deliver the content or as part of the
                    operation of the website, plug-in or application.</p>
                <p>When you provide information from your social media account, we may use this information
                    to personalize your experience on the Web Site and on the third-party social networking
                    websites, plug-ins, and applications, and to provide you with other products or services you
                    may request.</p>
                <h4>3.5 Links to Other Web Sites</h4>
                <p>Our Web Site may contain links to other Web sites or Internet resources that are provided
                    solely for your convenience and information. When you click on one of those links you are
                    contacting another Web site or Internet resource. HecoAnalytics has no responsibility or
                    liability for, or control over, those other Web sites or Internet resources or their collection,
                    use, and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
                <p>We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other Web sites to learn how they
                    collect and use your personal information.</p>
                <h3>4.HOW ELSE WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
                <p>In addition to the uses described above, HecoAnalytics may use your personal information
                    for a number of different business purposes, for example to:</p>

                    <li>for other purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>5.WHEN IS YOUR INFORMATION REMOVED</h3>
                <p>We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and to
                    meet any legal requirements. We have retention standards that meet these parameters. We
                    destroy or erase your information when it is no longer needed, or we remove your personally
                    identifiable information to render it anonymous.</p>
                <h3>6.HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>HecoAnalytics does not sell or rent our customers’ personal information to any other party.
                    However, in the normal course of business, we may share some of your personal information
                    within our corporate family and with third parties acting on our behalf or as permitted or
                    required by applicable law.</p>
                <p>Our affiliates and third-party service providers may be located outside of the UK and this
                    may result in personal information collected by HecoAnalytics being stored or processed
                    outside of UK and, as a result, your personal information may be accessible to law
                    enforcement, courts, and regulatory authorities in accordance with the law of these foreign
                    jurisdictions.</p>
                <h3>7. SERVICE PROVIDERS</h3>
                <p>HecoAnalytics may use third parties to manage one or more aspects of our business
                    operations, including the processing or handling of personal information. When we do use an
                    outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that your personal
                    information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>For example, we may share personal information with third parties to perform services on our
                    behalf such as hosting data securely and carrying out computational services.</p>
                <p>HecoAnalytics has taken precautions to prevent the fraudulent use of your information on our
                    Web Sites. HecoAnalytics has adopted industry-standard authentication procedures to ensure
                    your protection while shopping with us online. This includes, but is not limited to, contacting
                    financial institutions or credit reporting agencies to ensure the authenticity of your credit card
                    and to validate your credit card billing information.</p>
